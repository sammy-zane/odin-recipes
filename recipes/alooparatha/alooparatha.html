            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Aloo Parathas are Indian Breakfast flatbreads made with <em>wheat flour, boiled potatoes, spices and herbs.</em></p>

            <p>These are made the same way all over India with slight variations in the spices. Most commonly, they are topped with white butter and served alongside Pickle and Yogurt.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <li>Spices <ul>
                    <li>Cumin</li>
                    <li>Dried mango powder</li>
                    <li>Garam masala</li>
                    <li>Carom Seeds</li>
                    <li>Kashmiri red chilli powder</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Herbs (e.g. coriander)</li>
                <li>Salt and Oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl mix together whole wheat flour, salt and oil. Add water little by little and start mixing the dough. Knead to form a smooth and soft dough. I added around 3/4 cup + 1-2 tablespoons water here. You can also use the dough hook attachment of your stand mixer to knead the dough. Cover and let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes. Divide the dough into 4-6 equal parts.</li>
                <li>To make the filling, boil the potatoes first until they are completely done. You can use a regular pressure cooker and cook on high for 8 to 9 whistles or in instant pot for 10-15 minutes (or even more depending on the size of the potatoes). Once the potatoes are boiled, peel the skin, let them cool a bit and then transfer them to a bowl.</li>
                <li>Mash the potatoes and then add chopped green chili, cumin, dried mango powder, garam masala, carom seeds, kashmiri red chili powder, salt and coriander. Mix until everything is well combined. Taste test and adjust seasoning to taste. The stuffing for the paratha is now ready.</li>
                <li>Take the dough and divided it into 8 to 10 equal parts (depending on how big you want your parathas to be). Now, take one of the dough balls and roll it into a circle of around 4-5 inches in diameter. Apply around 1/2 teaspoon oil on the rolled dough. Then place around 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center (you can add more filling but donâ€™t overfill)</li>
                <li>Now, bring all the edges together to the center and then pinch to seal the edges. Flatten the dough ball using your hands.</li>
                <li>Now using your rolling pin, roll the dough to a circle of around 7 to 8 inches diameter. Use flour as needed while rolling. Dip the dough ball in flour as and when it becomes difficult to roll and then roll again. The trick here is to apply equal pressure while rolling. If you do that, your paratha will turn round automatically.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet on medium-high heat. Transfer the rolled paratha onto the hot skillet. </li>
                <li>Cook the side for a minute or two until it's partially cooked and then flip over. Apply oil, around 1/2 teaspoon on the half-cooked side and flip again.</li>
                <li>Now apply oil on the other side as well. Press with a spatula and cook the paratha until both sides have golden brown spots on them. Make sure to press the edges so that they get cooked as well.</li>
                <li>Repeat with the remaining dough balls and cook all the parathas similarly.</li>
